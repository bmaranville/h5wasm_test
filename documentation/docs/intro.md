# Introduction
a zero-dependency WebAssembly-powered library for reading and writing HDF5 files from javascript

(built on the [HDF5 C API](http://portal.hdfgroup.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=50073943))

The built binaries (esm and node) will be attached to the [latest release](https://github.com/usnistgov/h5wasm/releases/latest/) as h5wasm-\{version\}.tgz
  
The wasm-compiled libraries `libhdf5.a`, `libhdf5_cpp.a` ... and the related `include/` folder are retrieved from [libhdf5-wasm](https://github.com/usnistgov/libhdf5-wasm) during the build.
